      <t>This document discusses DoT/DoH deployment considerations for home
      networks. It particularly sketches the required steps to use DoT/DoH
      provided by local networks.</t>

      <t>One of the goals of the document is to assess to what extent existing
      tools can be used to provide such service. Extensions are proposed for
      identified gaps.</t>

      <t>Internet Service Providers (ISPs) traditionally provide DNS resolvers
      to their customers. Typically, ISPs deploy the following mechanisms to
      advertise a list of DNS resolvers to their customers: <?rfc subcompact="yes" ?></t>

      <t>The communication between a customer's device (Customer Premise
      Equipment (CPE) or User Equipment (UE)) and an ISP-supplied DNS resolver
      takes then place using cleartext DNS messages (Do53, <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-dnsop-terminology-ter"></xref>). Some examples are
      depicted in <xref target="do53"></xref>. For the case of cellular
      networks, connectivity can be directly provided to a UE or to a CPE.
      Mechanisms used within the LAN are similar in both fixed and cellular
      CPE-based broadband service offerings.</t>

      <t>ISPs use DNS to provide advanced services such as (non exhaustive)
      malware filtering, parental control, or VoD (Video on Demand)
      optimization. DNS is also a central component for mastering the quality
      of experience for current latency-sensitive services, but also emerging
      services (e.g., Ultra Reliability and Low Latency Communications (uRLLC)
      or Enhanced Mobile Broadband (eMBB)). <list style="empty">
          <t>For example, the latency targets set in the context of 5G are 1ms
          (uRLLC) and 4ms (eMBB). An ISP will be able to provide such services
          if deployed close to the user (e.g., by means of Edge Computing
          techniques and resources) and if the various involved communications
          legs are optimized (DNS, in particular).</t>
        </list>Relying upon local DNS resolvers will therefore contribute to
      meet the aforementioned service requirements. The use of external
      resolvers is likely to induce an extra service delay (e.g., 15 ms) which
      exceeds by far the service target (1 or 4 ms).</t>

      <t>This document focuses on the support of DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH) <xref
      target="RFC8484"></xref> or DNS-over-TLS (DoT) <xref
      target="RFC7858"></xref> by local networks. In particular, the document
      describes how a local DoH/DoT can be discovered and used by connected
      hosts.</t>

      <t>It is not the intent of this document to argue in favor or against
      the generalization of DoH/DoT. Likewise, it is not the intent of the
      document to evaluate the benifits/impacts of enabling DoH/DoT within
      some networks. Furthermore, it is not the intent of the document to
      discuss which information can be supplied to third-party resolvers
      (e.g., ECS) for the sake of proper delivery of some services nor how
      alternative technical options to DNS can be used to deliver the service
      that are currently "coupled" with the DNS service.</t>

      <t>Some ISPs rely upon external resolvers (e.g., outsourced service or
      public resolvers); these ISPs provide their customers with the IP
      addresses of these resolvers (configured on CPEs, typically) using the
      mechanisms listed above. This document does not preclude such
      deployments. It is up to each ISP to decide which list of DNS resolvers
      to advertise to its serviced devices.</t>

    <section anchor="depl" title="Sample Deployment Scenarios">
      <t>ISPs are used to manage service-specific configuration using, e.g.,
      TR-069. For example, these tools may be used to provision authentication
      domain name (ADN) (defined in <xref target="RFC8310"></xref>) to managed
      CPEs if DoH or DoT is supported by a local network similar to what is
      depicted in <xref target="wan"></xref>.</t>

      <t>DNS clients may try to establish DoH and/or DoT sessions with
      discovered DNS servers to determine whether these servers support DoH
      and/or DoT (<xref target="address"></xref>). Alternatively, a DNS client
      may discover whether the DNS server in the local network supports DoH or
      DoT by using the mechanism discussed in Section 6 of <xref
      target="I-D.reddy-dprive-dprive-privacy-policy"></xref>. If DoH is
      supported by the DNS server, the DNS client may query for the URI
      resource record type <xref target="RFC7553"></xref> to use the https URI
      scheme (Section 3 of <xref target="RFC8484"></xref>). </t>

      <t>The CPE relays the list of DoT/DoH servers it learns for the network
      using mechanisms (e.g., DHCP, RA). In such context, direct DoH/DoT
      sessions will be established between a host serviced by a CPE and an
      ISP-supplied DoT/DoH server (see the example depicted in <xref

      <t>In many deployments, the CPE embeds a DNS forwarder. The CPE
      advertises itself as the default DNS server to the hosts it serves. The
      CPE relies upon DHCP or RA to advertise itself to internal hosts as the
      default DoT/DoH/Do53 server. The CPE forwards DNS requests received from
      internal hosts and which it can not handle locally to an upstream
      DoH/DoT/Do53 resolver. Such deployment is required for IPv4 service
      continuity (e.g., <xref target="I-D.ietf-v6ops-rfc7084-bis"></xref>) or
      for supporting advanced services within the home (e.g., malware
      filtering, parental control, Manufacturer Usage Description (MUD) <xref
      target="RFC8520"></xref> to only allow intended communications to and
      from the IoT device). When the CPE behaves as a DNS forwarder, DNS
      communications can be decomposed into two legs:<list style="symbols">
          <t>The one between an internal host and the CPE.</t>

          <t>The second one between the CPE and an upstream DNS resolver.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>An ISP that wants to offer DoH/DoT to its customers may enable
      DoH/DoT in both legs as shown in <xref target="proxied"></xref>.
      Additional considerations related to this approach are discussed in

    <section anchor="forwarder" title="Hosting DoH/DoT Forwarder on the CPE">
      <t>The following mechanisms can be used in order to host DoH/DoT
      forwarder on the CPE:</t>

      <t><list style="symbols">
          <t>If a CPE is co-located with security services (e.g., malware
          filtering, parental control, MUD), the ISP can assign a unique FQDN
          (e.g., cpe1.example.com) and a domain-validated public certificate
          to the DoH/DoT forwarder on the CPE. <vspace
          blankLines="1" />Alternatively, the ISP can assign a unique FQDN to
          the managed CPE. The DoT/DoH forwarder will act like a public
          DoT/DoH server but will only be accessible from within the home
          network. DNS queries received outside the home network must be
          rejected by the DoH/DoT forwarder. This behavior adheres to REQ#8 in
          <xref target="RFC6092"></xref>, but must be applied for both IPv4
          and IPv6.</t>

          <t>'ACME IP Identifier Validation Extension' <xref
          target="I-D.ietf-acme-ip"></xref> can be used to issue a public
          certificate for the public IP address of the DoH/DoT forwarder. This
          mechanism requires the certificate issuance and renewal management
          to be done on the CPE itself. The HTTP Challenge (http-01) or TLS
          with Application Level Protocol Negotiation (TLS ALPN) challenge
          (tls-alpn-01) are used to prove the IP address ownership during
          certificate issuance. The issued certificate will have public IP
          address in iPAddress subjectAltName extension.<vspace
          blankLines="1" />The disadvantages of this mechanism are: (1) the
          certificate needs to be re-issued every time the IPv6 prefix or the
          public IPv4 address changes and (2) the CPE needs to run an HTTP(S)
          server until the ACME server validates that the challenge has
          completed and issues the requested certificate.</t>

    <section anchor="address" title="Locating DoH/DoT Servers">
      <t>As mentioned in <xref target="intro"></xref>, a CPE or a host relies
      upon discovery mechanisms (such as PCO, DHCP, or RA) to retrieve DoH and
      DoT servers hosted by local networks. In the various scenarios sketched
      in <xref target="depl"></xref>, Do53, DoH, and DoT may terminate on the
      same IP address (or distinct IP addresses as depicted in <xref
      target="selection"></xref>). Terminating Do53/DoH/DoT on the same or
      distinct IP addresses is deployment-specific. </t>

      <t>From an IP reachability standpoint, DoH/DoT servers should be located
      by their address literals rather than their names. This avoids adding a
      dependency on another server to resolve the DoH/DoT name. Concretely,
      existing discovery mechanisms can be leveraged to learn the IP addresses
      of DoT/DoH servers while an authentication domain name is supplied by
      one of the means discussed in <xref target="RI"></xref>.</t>

          <t>Note: It is unlikely that DoH and DoT will be offered

      <t>Additional considerations are discussed below for the use of DoH and
      DoT servers provided by local networks:<list style="symbols">
          <t>If the DNS server IP address discovered using DHCP/RA is
          pre-configured in the OS or browser as a trusted resolver, the DNS
          client auto-upgrades to use the discovered DoH/DoT server.</t>

          <t>If the DNS reference identity (<xref target="RI"></xref>) is
          provided by means of DHCP/RA, the DNS client matches the domain name
          in the DNS Reference Identifier DHCP/RA option with the 'DNS-ID'
          identifier type within subjectAltName entry in the server
          certificate conveyed in the TLS handshake.</t>

          <t>If the DNS reference identity is provided by means of DHCP/RA and
          the DNS client uses these IP addresses as a reference identity, the
          DNS client matches the IP address in the DNS DHCP/RA option with the
          'iPAddress' stored in the subjectAltName entry in the server
          certificate conveyed in the TLS handshake.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>Additional options are discussed below:</t>

      <t><list style="symbols">
          <t>The Wi-Fi Alliance has released the Device Provisioning Protocol
          (DPP). If DPP is used, the configurator can securely configure
          devices in the home network with the local DoT/DoH server using
          DPP.</t>

          <t>If a CPE is co-located with security services within the home
          network, the CPE can use WPA-PSK but with unique pre-shared keys for
          different endpoints to deal with security issues. In such networks,
          <xref target="I-D.reddy-dprive-dprive-privacy-policy"></xref> may be
          used to securely bootstrap endpoint devices with the authentication
          domain name (ADN) and DNS server certificate of the local network's
          DoH/DoT server. <vspace blankLines="1" />The OS would not know if
          the WPA pre-shared-key is the same for all clients or a unique
          pre-shared key is assigned to the host. Hence, the user has to
          indicate to the system that a unique pre-shared key is assigned to
          trigger the bootstrapping procedure. <vspace blankLines="1" />If the
          device joins a home network using a single shared password among all
          the attached devices, a compromised device can host a fake access
          point, and the device cannot be securely bootstrapped with the home
          network's DoH/DoT server.</t>
        </list></t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>An attacker can get a domain name, doman-validated public certificate
      from a CA, host a DoT/DoH server and claim the best DNS privacy
      preservation policy. Also, an attacker within the home network can use
      the public IP address, get an 'IP address'-validated public certificate
      from a CA, host a DoT/DoH server and claim the best DNS privacy
      preservation policy.</t>

      <t>Because DHCP/RA messages are not encrypted or protected against
      modification in any way, their content can be spoofed or modified by
      compromised devices within the home network. An attacker can spoof the
      DHCP/RA response to provide the attacker's DoT/DoH server. Note that
      such an attacker can mount other attacks as discussed in Section 22 of
      <xref target="RFC8415"></xref>. Furthermore, if the browser or the OS is
      pre-configured with a list of DNS servers where some perform malware
      filtering and others do not, an attacker can prevent contacting the
      preferred filtering DNS servers causing a downgrade attack to a
      non-filtering DNS server, which the attacker can leverage to deliver
      malware.</t>

      <t>The use of DoH/DoT also depends on the user's policies. For example,
      the user may indicate his/her consent to use (or not) the
      locally-discovered DoH/DoT server. The DNS client must adhere to these
      policies.</t>

      <t>DoH/DoT servers discovered using insecure discovery mechanisms like
      DHCP/RA are used by a DNS client if the insecurely discovered DoH/DoT
      server is pre-configured in the OS or the browser. </t>

      <t>DoH/DoT servers discovered using insecure discovery mechanisms like
      DHCP/RA are used by a DNS client if the insecurely discovered DoH/DoT
      server is pre-configured in the OS or the browser, offers malware
      filtering service and meets the privacy preserving data policy
      requirements of the user.</t>

      <t>If the insecurely discovered DoH/DoT server is not pre-configured in
      the OS or browser, its policy information must be cryptographically
      attested by the ISP (e.g., <xref
      target="I-D.reddy-dprive-dprive-privacy-policy"></xref>); user consent
      is required to use the locally-discovered DoH/DoT server. </t>

      <t>DOT/DoH sessions with rogue servers spoofing the IP address of a DNS
      server will fail because the DNS client will fail to authenticate that
      rogue server because of PKIX authentication <xref
      target="RFC6125"></xref> based on the authentication domain name in the
      Reference Identifier Option. DNS clients that ignore authentication
      failures and accept spoofed certificate will be subject to attacks
      (e.g., redirect to malicious servers, intercept sensitive data). </t>
