    <section anchor="RI" title="Overview">
      <t>This document describes how a DNS client can discover local encrypted
      DNS servers using DHCP (Sections <xref format="counter"
      target="DHCPv6"></xref> and <xref format="counter"
      target="DHCP"></xref>) and Neighbor Discovery protocol (<xref
      target="RA"></xref>): Encrypted DNS options. </t>

      <t>These options configure an authentication domain name, a list of IPv6
      addresses, and a set of service parameters of the encrypted DNS server.
      More information about the design of these options is provided in the
      following subsections. </t>

      <section title="Configuration Data for Encrypted DNS">
        <t>In order to allow for PKIX-based authentication between a DNS
        client and an encrypted DNS server, the Encrypted DNS options are
        designed to include an authentication domain name. This ADN is
        presented as a reference identifier for DNS authentication purposes.
        This design accommodates the current best practices for issuing
        certificates as per Section 1.7.2 of <xref target="RFC6125"></xref>:
        </t>

        <t><figure>
            <artwork><![CDATA[   |  Some certification authorities issue server certificates based on
   |  IP addresses, but preliminary evidence indicates that such
   |  certificates are a very small percentage (less than 1%) of issued
   |  certificates.]]></artwork>
          </figure></t>

        <t>To avoid adding a dependency on another server to resolve the ADN,
        the Encrypted DNS options return the IP address(es) to locate the
        encrypted DNS server. In the various scenarios sketched in <xref
        target="depl"></xref>, encrypted DNS servers may terminate on the same
        IP address or distinct IP addresses. Terminating encrypted DNS servers
        on the same or distinct IP addresses is deployment specific.</t>

        <t>In order to optimize the size of discovery messages when all
        servers terminate on the same IP address, early versions of this
        document considered relying upon the discovery mechanisms specified in
        <xref target="RFC2132"></xref><xref target="RFC3646"></xref><xref
        target="RFC8106"></xref> to retrieve a list of IP addresses to reach
        their DNS servers. Nevertheless, this approach requires a client that
        supports more than one encrypted DNS to probe that list of IP
        addresses. To avoid such probing, the options defined in the following
        sections associate an IP address with an encrypted DNS type. No
        probing is required in such a design.</t>

        <t>A list of IP addresses to reach an encrypted DNS server may be
        returned in the Encrypted DNS options to accommodate current
        deployments relying upon primary and backup servers. Whether one IP
        address or more are returned in an Encrypted DNS option is deployment
        specific. For example, a router embedding a recursive server or
        forwarder has to include one single IP address pointing to one of its
        LAN-facing interfaces. This address can be a private IPv4 address, a
        link-local address, a Unique Local IPv6 unicast Address (ULA), or a
        Global Unicast Address (GUA).</t>

        <t>If more than one IP address are to be returned in an Encrypted DNS
        option, these addresses are ordered in the preference for use by the
        client.</t>

        <t>Because distinct Encrypted DNS protocols may be provisioned by a
        network (e.g., DoT, DoH, and DoQ) and that some of these protocols may
        make use of customized port numbers instead of default ones, the
        Encrypted DNS options are designed to return a set of service
        parameters. These parameters are encoded following the same rules for
        encoding SvcParams in Section 2.1 of <xref
        target="I-D.ietf-dnsop-svcb-https"></xref>. This encoding approach may
        increase the size of the options but it has the merit to rely upon an
        existing IANA registry and thus to accommodate new Encrypted DNS
        protocols and service parameters that may be defined in the future.
        For example, "dohpath" service parameter (Section 5.1 of <xref
        target="I-D.schwartz-svcb-dns"></xref>) supplies a relative DoH URI
        Template.</t>

        <t>A single option is used to convey both the ADN and IP addresses
        because otherwise means to correlate an IP address with an ADN will be
        required if, for example, more than one ADN is supported by the
        network. </t>
      </section>

      <section title="Handling Configuration Data Conflicts">
        <t>If the encrypted DNS is discovered by a host using both RA and
        DHCP, the rules discussed in Section 5.3.1 of <xref
        target="RFC8106"></xref> MUST be followed.</t>

        <t>DHCP/RA options to discover encrypted DNS servers (including, DoH
        URI Templates) takes precedence over DDR <xref
        target="I-D.ietf-add-ddr"></xref> since DDR uses unencrypted DNS to an
        external DNS resolver, which is susceptible to both internal and
        external attacks whereas DHCP/RA is typically protected using the
        mechanisms discussed in <xref target="spoof"></xref>.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Connection Establishment">
        <t>If the local DNS client supports one of the discovered Encrypted
        DNS protocols identified by Application Layer Protocol Negotiation
        (ALPN) protocol identifiers, the DNS client establishes an encrypted
        DNS session following the order of the discovered servers. The client
        follows the mechanism discussed in Section 8 of <xref
        target="RFC8310"></xref> to authenticate the DNS server certificate
        using the authentication domain name conveyed in the Encrypted DNS
        options. ALPN-related considerations can be found in Section 6.1 of
        <xref target="I-D.ietf-dnsop-svcb-https"></xref>.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Multihoming Considerations">
        <t>Devices may be connected to multiple networks; each providing their
        own DNS configuration using the discovery mechanisms specified in this
        document. Nevertheless, it is out of the scope of this specification
        to discuss DNS selection of multi-interface devices. The reader may
        refer to <xref target="RFC6731"></xref> for a discussion of issues and
        an example of DNS server selection for multi-interfaced devices.</t>

      <section anchor="forwarder_m" title="Managed CPEs">
        <t>The section discusses mechanisms that can be used to host an
        encrypted DNS forwarder in a managed CPE (<xref
        target="mcpe"></xref>).</t>

        <section title="DNS Forwarders">
          <t>The managed CPE should support a configuration parameter to
          instruct the CPE whether it has to relay the encrypted DNS server
          received from the ISP's network or has to announce itself as a
          forwarder within the local network. The default behavior of the CPE
          is to supply the encrypted DNS server received from the ISP's
          network.</t>
        </section>

        <section anchor="acme" title="ACME">
          <t>The ISP can assign a unique FQDN (e.g., "cpe1.example.com") and a
          domain-validated public certificate to the encrypted DNS forwarder
          hosted on the CPE. Automatic Certificate Management Environment
          (ACME) <xref target="RFC8555"></xref> can be used by the ISP to
          automate certificate management functions such as domain validation
          procedure, certificate issuance and certificate revocation.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Auto-Upgrade Based on Domains and their Subdomains">
          <t>If the ADN conveyed in DHCP/RA (Sections <xref format="counter"
          target="DHCPv6"></xref>, <xref format="counter"
          target="DHCP"></xref>, and <xref format="counter"
          target="RA"></xref>) is preconfigured in popular OSes or browsers as
          a verified resolver and the auto-upgrade (<xref
          target="Auto"></xref>) is allowed for both the preconfigured ADN and
          its sub-domains, the encrypted DNS client will learn the local
          encrypted DNS forwarder using DHCP/RA and auto-upgrade because the
          preconfigured ADN would match the subjectAltName value in the server
          certificate. For example, if the preconfigured ADN is
          "*.example.com" and the discovered encrypted DNS forwarder is
          "cpe1.example.com", auto-upgrade will take place.</t>

          <t>In this case, the CPE can communicate the ADN of the local DoH
          forwarder (<xref target="acme"></xref>) to internal hosts using
          DHCP/RA (Sections <xref format="counter" target="DHCPv6"></xref>,
          <xref format="counter" target="DHCP"></xref>, and <xref
          format="counter" target="RA"></xref>).</t>

          <t>Let's suppose that "*.example.net" is preconfigured as a verified
          resolved in the browser or OS. If the encrypted DNS client discovers
          a local forwarder "cpe1-internal.example.net", the encrypted DNS
          client will auto-upgrade because the preconfigured ADN would match
          subjectAltName value "cpe1-internal.example.net" of type dNSName. As
          shown in <xref target="subdomainex"></xref>, the auto-upgrade to a
          rogue server advertising "rs.example.org" will fail because it does
          not match "*.example.net". <figure align="center"

    <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
      <section anchor="spoof" title="Spoofing Attacks">
        <t>DHCP/RA messages are not encrypted or protected against
        modification within the LAN. Unless mitigated (described below), the
        content of DHCP and RA messages can be spoofed or modified by active
        attackers, such as compromised devices within the local network. An
        active attacker (Section 3.3 of <xref target="RFC3552"></xref>) can
        spoof the DHCP/RA response to provide the attacker's Encrypted DNS
        server. Note that such an attacker can launch other attacks as
        discussed in Section 22 of <xref target="RFC8415"></xref>. The
        attacker can get a domain name with a domain-validated public
        certificate from a CA and host an Encrypted DNS server. Also, an
        attacker can use a public IP address and get an 'IP address'-validated
        public certificate from a CA to host an Encrypted DNS server.</t>

        <t>Attacks of spoofed or modified DHCP responses and RA messages by
        attackers within the local network may be mitigated by making use of
        the following mechanisms:</t>

        <t><list style="symbols">
            <t>DHCPv6-Shield described in <xref target="RFC7610"></xref>, the
            CPEs discards DHCP response messages received from any local
            endpoint.</t>

            <t>RA-Guard described in <xref target="RFC7113"></xref>, the CPE
            discards RAs messages received from any local endpoint.</t>

            <t>Source Address Validation Improvement (SAVI) solution for DHCP
            described in <xref target="RFC7513"></xref>, the CPE filters
            packets with forged source IP addresses.</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>Encrypted DNS sessions with rogue servers that spoof the IP address
        of a DNS server will fail because the DNS client will fail to
        authenticate that rogue server based upon PKIX authentication <xref
        target="RFC6125"></xref>, particularly the authentication domain name
        in the Encrypted DNS Option. DNS clients that ignore authentication
        failures and accept spoofed certificates will be subject to attacks
        (e.g., redirect to malicious servers, intercept sensitive data).</t>

        <t>Encrypted DNS connections received from outside the local network
        MUST be discarded by the encrypted DNS forwarder in the CPE. This
        behavior adheres to REQ#8 in <xref target="RFC6092"></xref>; it MUST
        apply for both IPv4 and IPv6.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Deletion Attacks">
        <t>If the DHCP responses or RAs are dropped by the attacker, the
        client can fallback to use a preconfigured encrypted DNS server.
        However, the use of policies to select servers is out of the scope of
        this document.</t>

      <section title="Passive Attacks">
        <t>A passive attacker (Section 3.2 of <xref target="RFC3552"></xref>)
        can identify a host is using DHCP/RA to discover an encrypted DNS
        server and can infer that host is capable of using DoH/DoT/DoQ to
        encrypt DNS messages. However, a passive attacker cannot spoof or
        modify DHCP/RA messages.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Wireless Security - Authentication Attacks">
        <t>Wireless LAN (WLAN) as frequently deployed in local networks (e.g.,
        home networks) is vulnerable to various attacks (e.g., <xref
        target="Evil-Twin"></xref>, <xref target="Krack"></xref>, <xref
        target="Dragonblood"></xref>). Because of these attacks, only
        cryptographically authenticated communications are trusted on WLANs.
        This means that an information (e.g., NTP server, DNS server, default
        domain) provided by such networks via DHCP, DHCPv6, or RA are
        untrusted because DHCP and RA messages are not authenticated.</t>

        <t>If the pre-shared-key is the same for all clients that connect to
        the same WLAN, the shared key will be available to all nodes,
        including attackers. As such, it is possible to mount an active
        on-path attack. Man-in-the-middle attacks are possible within local
        networks because such WLAN authentication lacks peer entity
        authentication.</t>

        <t>This leads to the need for provisioning unique credentials for
        different clients. Endpoints can be provisioned with unique
        credentials (username and password, typically) provided by the local
        network administrator to mutually authenticate to the local WLAN
        Access Point (e.g., 802.1x Wireless User Authentication on OpenWRT
        <xref target="dot1x"></xref>, EAP-pwd <xref target="RFC8146"></xref>).
        Not all endpoint devices (e.g., IoT devices) support 802.1x supplicant
        and need an alternate mechanism to connect to the local network. To
        address this limitation, unique pre-shared keys can be created for
        each such device and WPA-PSK is used (e.g., <xref
        target="PSK"></xref>).</t>

    <section anchor="depl" title="Sample Target Deployment Scenarios">
      <t>Internet Service Providers (ISPs) traditionally provide DNS resolvers
      to their customers. To that aim, ISPs deploy the following mechanisms to
      advertise a list of DNS Recursive DNS server(s) to their customers:</t>

      <t><list style="symbols">
          <t>Protocol Configuration Options in cellular networks <xref
          target="TS.24008"></xref>.</t>

          <t>DHCPv4 <xref target="RFC2132"></xref> (Domain Name Server Option)
          or DHCPv6 <xref target="RFC8415"></xref><xref
          target="RFC3646"></xref> (OPTION_DNS_SERVERS).</t>

          <t>IPv6 Router Advertisement <xref target="RFC4861"></xref><xref
          target="RFC8106"></xref> (Type 25 (Recursive DNS Server
          Option)).</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>The communication between a customer's device (possibly via Customer
      Premises Equipment (CPE)) and an ISP-supplied DNS resolver takes place
      by using cleartext DNS messages (Do53). Some examples are depicted in
      <xref target="do53"></xref>. In the case of cellular networks, the
      cellular network will provide connectivity directly to a host (e.g.,
      smartphone, tablet) or via a CPE. Do53 mechanisms used within the Local
      Area Network (LAN) are similar in both fixed and cellular CPE-based
      broadband service offerings.</t>

      <t>Some ISPs rely upon external resolvers (e.g., outsourced service or
      public resolvers); these ISPs provide their customers with the IP
      addresses of these resolvers. These addresses are typically configured
      on CPEs using dedicated management tools. Likewise, users can modify the
      default DNS configuration of their CPEs (e.g., supplied by their ISP) to
      configure their favorite DNS servers. This document permits such
      deployments.</t>

          relays the list of encrypted DNS servers it learns for the network
          by using mechanisms like DHCP or a specific Router Advertisement

        <section title="Proxied DNS">
          <t><xref target="proxied"></xref> shows a deployment where the CPE
          embeds a caching DNS forwarder. The CPE advertises itself as the
          default DNS server to the hosts it serves. The CPE relies upon DHCP
          or RA to advertise itself to internal hosts as the default
          DoT/DoH/Do53 server. When receiving a DNS request it cannot handle
          locally, the CPE forwards the request to an upstream DoH/DoT/Do53
          resolver. Such deployment is required for IPv4 service continuity
          purposes (e.g., Section 5.4.1 of <xref
          target="I-D.ietf-v6ops-rfc7084-bis"></xref>) or for supporting
          advanced services within a local network (e.g., malware filtering,
          parental control, Manufacturer Usage Description (MUD) <xref
          target="RFC8520"></xref> to only allow intended communications to
          and from an IoT device). When the CPE behaves as a DNS forwarder,
          DNS communications can be decomposed into two legs:<list
              style="symbols">
              <t>The leg between an internal host and the CPE.</t>

              <t>The leg between the CPE and an upstream DNS resolver.</t>
            </list></t>

          <t>An ISP that offers encrypted DNS to its customers may enable
          encrypted DNS in one or both legs as shown in <xref
          target="proxied"></xref>. Additional considerations related to this
          deployment are discussed in <xref target="forwarder"></xref>.</t>

        <section title="ISP-facing Unmanaged CPEs">
          <t>Customers may decide to deploy unmanaged CPEs (assuming the CPE
          is compliant with the network access technical specification that is
          usually published by ISPs). Upon attachment to the network, an
          unmanaged CPE receives from the network its service configuration
          (including the DNS information) by means of, e.g., DHCP. That DNS
          information is shared within the LAN following the same mechanisms
          as those discussed in <xref target="mcpe"></xref>. A host can thus
          establish DoH/DoT session with a DoH/DoT server similar to what is
          depicted in <xref target="direct"></xref> or <xref
          target="proxied"></xref>.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Internal Unmanaged CPEs">
          <t>Customers may also decide to deploy internal routers (called
          hereafter, Internal CPEs) for a variety of reasons that are not
          detailed here. Absent any explicit configuration on the internal CPE
          to override the DNS configuration it receives from the ISP-supplied
          CPE, an Internal CPE relays the DNS information it receives via
          DHCP/RA from the ISP-supplied CPE to connected hosts. Encrypted DNS
          sessions can be established by a host with the DNS servers of the
          ISP (see <xref target="internal_isp"></xref>).</t>

          <t>Similar to managed CPEs, a user may modify the default DNS
          configuration of an unmanaged CPE to use his/her favorite DNS
          servers instead. Encrypted DNS sessions can be established directly

             title="Make Use of Discovered Encrypted DNS Servers">
      <t>Even if the use of a discovered encrypted DNS server is beyond the
      discovery process and falls under encrypted server selection, the
      following discusses typical conditions under which discovered encrypted
      DNS server can be used. <list style="symbols">
          <t>If the DNS server's IP address discovered by using DHCP/RA is
          preconfigured in the OS or Browser as a verified resolver (e.g.,
          part of an auto-upgrade program such as <xref
          target="Auto-upgrade"></xref>), the DNS client auto-upgrades to use
          the preconfigured encrypted DNS server tied to the discovered DNS
          server IP address. In such a case the DNS client will perform
          additional checks out of band, such as confirming that the Do53 IP
          address and the encrypted DNS server are owned and operated by the
          same organisation.</t>

          <t>Similarly, if the ADN conveyed in DHCP/RA (Sections <xref
          format="counter" target="DHCPv6"></xref>, <xref format="counter"
          target="DHCP"></xref>, and <xref format="counter"
          target="RA"></xref>) is preconfigured in the OS or browser as a
          verified resolver, the DNS client auto-upgrades to establish an
          encrypted a DoH/DoT/DoQ session with the ADN.<vspace
          blankLines="1" />In such case, the DNS client matches the domain
          name in the Encrypted DNS DHCP/RA option with the 'DNS-ID'
          identifier type within subjectAltName entry in the server
          certificate conveyed in the TLS handshake.</t>

      and <xref format="counter" target="RA"></xref> won't be able to learn
      the encrypted DNS server hosted by the ISP, in particular. If the ADN is
      not discovered using DHCP/RA, such hosts will have to fallback to use
      discovery using the resolver IP address as defined in Section 4 of <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-add-ddr"></xref> to discover the designated resolvers.
      The guidance in Sections 4.1 and 4.2 of <xref
