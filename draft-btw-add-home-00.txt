          DoH/DoT Deployment Considerations for Home Networks
                         draft-btw-add-home-00

Abstract

   This document discusses DoT/DoH deployment considerations for home
   networks.  It particularly sketches the required steps to use DoT/DoH
   capabilities provided by local networks.

   One of the goals of this document is to assess to what extent
   existing tools can be used to provide a DoT/DoH service.  As an
   outcome, new DHCP and Router Advertisement Options are specified in
   order to convey a DNS Authentication Domain Name.

1.  Introduction

   Internet Service Providers (ISPs) traditionally provide DNS resolvers
   to their customers.  Typically, ISPs deploy the following mechanisms
   to advertise a list of DNS resolvers to their customers:

   o  Protocol Configuration Options in cellular networks (TS.24008).
   o  CPE WAN Management Protocol (TR-069).
   o  DHCP [RFC2132] or DHCPv6 [RFC8415][RFC3646].
   o  IPv6 Router Advertisement [RFC8106].

   The communication between a customer's device (Customer Premise
   Equipment (CPE) or User Equipment (UE)) and an ISP-supplied DNS
   resolver takes place by using cleartext DNS messages (Do53,
   [I-D.ietf-dnsop-terminology-ter]).  Some examples are depicted in
   Figure 1.  In the case of cellular networks, connectivity can be
   provided to a UE or to a CPE.  Do53 mechanisms used within the LAN
   are similar in both fixed and cellular CPE-based broadband service
   offerings.

                    Figure 1: Sample Legacy Deployments

   ISPs use DNS to provide additional services such as (but not limited
   to) malware filtering, parental control, or VoD (Video on Demand)
   optimization.  DNS is also a central component for mastering the
   quality of experience for current latency-sensitive services, but
   also emerging ones (such as those services that pertain to the Ultra
   Reliability and Low Latency Communications (uRLLC) or Enhanced Mobile
   Broadband (eMBB).

      For example, the latency targets set in the context of 5G are 1ms
      (uRLLC) and 4ms (eMBB).  An ISP will be able to address such
      demanding latency requirements assuming the corresponding services
      rely upon resources (network, compute, sotrage) that are located
      as close to the user as possible (e.g., by means of Edge Computing
      techniques and resources).  Such latency requirements are likely
      to be adressed by means of optimized designs (DNS, in particular),
      too.

   Relying upon local DNS resolvers will therefore contribute to meet
   the aforementioned service requirements.  The use of external
   resolvers is likely to induce an extra service delay which exceeds by
   far the service target (1 or 4 ms).

   This document focuses on the support of DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH)
   [RFC8484] or DNS-over-TLS (DoT) [RFC7858] in local networks.  In
   particular, the document describes how a local DoH/DoT server can be
   discovered and used by connected hosts.

Internet-Draft               DoH/DoT in Home                  March 2020


   It is not the intent of this document to argue in favor or against
   the generalization of DoH/DoT.  Likewise, it is not the intent of
   this document to evaluate the benefits and impacts of enabling DoH/
   DoT within some networks.  Furthermore, it is not the intent of this
   document to discuss which information can be supplied to third-party
   resolvers (e.g., EDNS Client Subnet, [RFC7871]) for the sake of
   properly delivering some services nor how alternative options to DNS
   can be used to deliver the service that are currently "bound" with
   the DNS service.

   Some ISPs rely upon external resolvers (e.g., outsourced service or
   public resolvers); these ISPs provide their customers with the IP
   addresses of these resolvers (these addresses are typically
   configured on CPEs) using the mechanisms listed above.  This document
   does not preclude such deployments.  It is up to an ISP to decide
   which list of DNS resolvers to advertise to its serviced devices.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119][RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   This document makes use of the terms defined in [RFC8499] and
   [I-D.ietf-dnsop-terminology-ter].

   'DoH/DoT' refers to DNS-over-HTTPS and/or DNS-over-TLS.

3.  Sample Deployment Scenarios

   ISPs have developed an expertise in managing service-specific
   configuration information, using, e.g., TR-069.  For example, these
   tools may be used to provision authentication domain name information
   (ADN, defined in [RFC8310]) to managed CPEs if DoH or DoT is
   supported by a local network similar to what is depicted in Figure 2.

   DNS clients may try to establish DoH and/or DoT sessions with
   discovered DNS servers to determine whether these servers support DoH
   and/or DoT (Section 6).  Alternatively, a DNS client may discover
   whether the DNS server in the local network supports DoH or DoT by
   using the mechanism discussed in Section 6 of
   [I-D.reddy-dprive-dprive-privacy-policy].  If DoH is supported by the
   DNS server, the DNS client may request the URI resource record type
   [RFC7553] to use the HTTPS URI scheme (Section 3 of [RFC8484]).

   The CPE relays the list of DoT/DoH servers it learns for the network
   by using mechanisms like DHCP or a specific Router Advertisement
   message.  In such context, direct DoH/DoT sessions will be
   established between a host serviced by a CPE and an ISP-supplied DoT/
   DoH server (see the example depicted in Figure 3 for a DoH/DoT-
   capable host).

   In many deployments, the CPE embeds a DNS forwarder.  The CPE
   advertises itself as the default DNS server to the hosts it serves.
   The CPE relies upon DHCP or RA to advertise itself to internal hosts
   as the default DoT/DoH/Do53 server.  The CPE forwards DNS requests
   received from internal hosts that it cannot handle locally to an
   upstream DoH/DoT/Do53 resolver.  Such deployment is required for IPv4
   service continuity purposes (e.g., [I-D.ietf-v6ops-rfc7084-bis]) or
   for supporting advanced services within the home (e.g., malware

   filtering, parental control, Manufacturer Usage Description (MUD,
   [RFC8520] to only allow intended communications to and from an IoT
   device).  When the CPE behaves as a DNS forwarder, DNS communications
   can be decomposed into two legs:

   o  The one between an internal host and the CPE.

   o  The second one between the CPE and an upstream DNS resolver.

   An ISP that wants to offer DoH/DoT to its customers may enable DoH/
   DoT in both legs as shown in Figure 4.  Additional considerations
   related to this approach are discussed in Section 4.

4.  Hosting DoH/DoT Forwarder in the CPE

   The following mechanisms can be used to host a DoH/DoT forwarder in
   the CPE:

   o  If a CPE is co-located with security services (e.g., malware
      filtering, parental control, MUD), the ISP can assign a unique
      FQDN (e.g., cpe1.example.com) and a domain-validated public
      certificate to the DoH/DoT forwarder to the CPE.

      Alternatively, the ISP can assign a unique FQDN to the managed
      CPE.  The DoT/DoH forwarder will act like a public DoT/DoH server
      but will only be accessible from within the home network.  DNS
      queries received outside the home network must be discarded by the
      DoH/DoT forwarder.  This behavior adheres to REQ#8 in [RFC6092],
      and must apply for both IPv4 and IPv6.

   o  'ACME IP Identifier Validation Extension' [RFC8738] can be used to
      issue a public certificate for the public IP address of the DoH/
      DoT forwarder.  This mechanism requires the issuance of the
      certificate and the management of the certificate's renewal to be
      supported by the CPE itself.  The HTTP Challenge (http-01) or TLS
      with Application Level Protocol Negotiation (TLS ALPN) challenge
      (tls-alpn-01) are used to prove the IP address ownership during



Boucadair, et al.       Expires September 3, 2020               [Page 6]

Internet-Draft               DoH/DoT in Home                  March 2020


      the issuance of the certificate.  This certificate will carry a
      public IP address in iPAddress subjectAltName extension.

      The disadvantages of this mechanism are: (1) the certificate needs
      to be re-issued every time the IPv6 prefix or the public IPv4
      address changes and (2) the CPE needs to run an HTTP(S) server
      until the ACME server validates that the challenge has completed
      so that the ACME server can issue the requested certificate.

5.  DNS Reference Identifier Option

   As reported in Section 1.7.2 of [RFC6125]:

      "few certification authorities issue server certificates based on
      IP addresses, but preliminary evidence indicates that such
      certificates are a very small percentage (less than 1%) of issued
      certificates".

   In order to allow for PKIX-based authentication between a DNS client
   and a DoH/DoT server while accommodating the current best practices
   for issuing certificates, this document allows for configuring an
   authentication domain name and an IP address to be presented as a
   reference identifier for DNS authentication purposes.

   The DNS client establishes a DoH/DoT session with the discovered DNS
   IP address(es) (Section 6) and uses the mechanism discussed in
   Section 8 of [RFC8310] to authenticate the DNS server certificate
   using the authentication domain name conveyed in the DNS Reference
   Identifier.

5.1.  Format of DHCPv6 DNS Reference Identifier Option

   The DHCPv6 DNS Reference Identifier option is used to configure an
   authentication domain name of the DoH/DoT server.  The format of this
   option is shown in Figure 5.

5.3.  Format of RA DNS Reference Identifier Option

   The IPv6 Router Advertisement (RA) DNS Reference Identifier option is
   used to configure an authentication domain name of the DoH/DoT
   server.  The format of this option is illustrated in Figure 8.

               Figure 8: RA DNS Reference Identifier Option

   The fields of the option shown in Figure 8 are as follows:

   o  Type: 8-bit identifier of the DNS Reference Identifier Option as
      assigned by IANA (TBA3, see Section 8.3).
   o  Length: 8-bit unsigned integer.  The length of the option
      (including the Type and Length fields) is in units of 8 octets.
   o  Reserved: This field is unused.  It MUST be initialized to zero by
      the sender and MUST be ignored by the receiver.
   o  Lifetime: 32-bit unsigned integer.  The maximum time in seconds
      (relative to the time the packet is received) over which the
      authentication domain name MAY be used as a DNS Reference
      Identifier.  The value of Lifetime SHOULD by default be at least 3
      * MaxRtrAdvInterval, where MaxRtrAdvInterval is the maximum RA
      interval as defined in [RFC4861].  A value of all one bits
      (0xffffffff) represents infinity.  A value of zero means that the
      DNS Reference Identifier MUST no longer be used.
   o  Authentication domain name: The domain name of the DoH/DoT server.
      This field is formatted as specified in Section 10 of [RFC8415].

6.  Locating DoH/DoT Servers

   As mentioned in Section 1, a CPE or a host relies upon discovery
   mechanisms (such as PCO, DHCP, or RA) to retrieve DoH and DoT
   servers' reachability information, and hosted by local networks.  In
   the various scenarios sketched in Section 3, Do53, DoH, and DoT may
   terminate on the same IP address (or distinct IP addresses as
   depicted in Figure 9).  Terminating Do53/DoH/DoT on the same or
   distinct IP addresses is deployment-specific.

Internet-Draft               DoH/DoT in Home                  March 2020


   From an IP reachability standpoint, DoH/DoT servers should be located
   by their address literals rather than their names.  This avoids
   adding a dependency on another server to resolve the DoH/DoT name.
   Concretely, existing discovery mechanisms can be leveraged to learn
   the IP addresses of DoT/DoH servers while an authentication domain
   name is supplied by one of the options discussed in Section 5.

      Note: It is unlikely that DoH and DoT will be offered
      simultaneously, but we need to indicate which one wins if DoH and
      DoT are supported.

               Figure 9: Locating DoH/DoT/Do53 using RFC8106

   Additional considerations are discussed below for the use of DoH and
   DoT servers provided by local networks:

   o  If the DNS server's IP address discovered by using DHCP/RA is pre-
      configured in the OS or browser as a trusted resolver, the DNS
      client auto-upgrades to use the discovered DoH/DoT server.

   o  If the DNS reference identity (Section 5) is provided by means of
      DHCP/RA, the DNS client matches the domain name in the DNS
      Reference Identifier DHCP/RA option with the 'DNS-ID' identifier
      type within subjectAltName entry in the server certificate
      conveyed in the TLS handshake.

   o  If the DNS reference identity is provided by means of DHCP/RA and
      the DNS client uses these IP addresses as a reference identity,
      the DNS client matches the IP address in the DNS DHCP/RA option

      with the 'iPAddress' stored in the subjectAltName entry in the
      server certificate conveyed in the TLS handshake.

   Additional options are discussed below:

   o  The Wi-Fi Alliance has released the Device Provisioning Protocol
      (DPP).  If DPP is used, the configurator can securely configure
      devices in the home network with the local DoT/DoH server using
      DPP.

   o  If a CPE is co-located with security services within the home
      network, the CPE can use WPA-PSK but with unique pre-shared keys
      for different endpoints to deal with security issues.  In such
      networks, [I-D.reddy-dprive-bootstrap-dns-server] may be used to
      securely bootstrap endpoint devices with the authentication domain
      name (ADN) and DNS server certificate of the local network's DoH/
      DoT server.

      The OS would not know if the WPA pre-shared-key is the same for
      all clients or a unique pre-shared key is assigned to the host.
      Hence, the user has to indicate to the system that a unique pre-
      shared key is assigned to trigger the bootstrapping procedure.

      If the device joins a home network using a single shared password
      among all the attached devices, a compromised device can host a
      fake access point, and the device cannot be securely bootstrapped
      with the home network's DoH/DoT server.

7.  Security Considerations

   An attacker can get a domain name, doman-validated public certificate
   from a CA, host a DoT/DoH server and claim the best DNS privacy
   preservation policy.  Also, an attacker within the home network can
   use the public IP address, get an 'IP address'-validated public
   certificate from a CA, host a DoT/DoH server and claim the best DNS
   privacy preservation policy.

   Because DHCP/RA messages are not encrypted or protected against
   modification in any way, their content can be spoofed or modified by
   compromised devices within the home network.  An attacker can spoof
   the DHCP/RA response to provide the attacker's DoT/DoH server.  Note
   that such an attacker can launch other attacks as discussed in
   Section 22 of [RFC8415].  Furthermore, if the browser or the OS is
   pre-configured with a list of DNS servers and some of which perform
   malware filtering while others do not, an attacker can prevent
   contacting the preferred filtering DNS servers causing a downgrade
   attack to a non-filtering DNS server, which the attacker can leverage
   to deliver malware.

Internet-Draft               DoH/DoT in Home                  March 2020


   The use of DoH/DoT also depends on the user's policies.  For example,
   the user may indicate his/her consent to use (or not) the locally-
   discovered DoH/DoT server.  The DNS client must adhere to these
   policies.

   DoH/DoT servers discovered using insecure discovery mechanisms like
   DHCP/RA are used by a DNS client if the insecurely discovered DoH/DoT
   server is pre-configured in the OS or the browser.

   If the insecurely discovered DoH/DoT server is not pre-configured in
   the OS or browser, its policy information must be cryptographically
   attested by the ISP (e.g., [I-D.reddy-dprive-dprive-privacy-policy]);
   user consent is required to use the locally-discovered DoH/DoT
   server.

   DoT/DoH sessions with rogue servers spoofing the IP address of a DNS
   server will fail because the DNS client will fail to authenticate
   that rogue server based upon PKIX authentication [RFC6125] , and
   which relies upon the authentication domain name in the Reference
   Identifier Option.  DNS clients that ignore authentication failures
   and accept spoofed certificates will be subject to attacks (e.g.,
   redirect to malicious servers, intercept sensitive data).
